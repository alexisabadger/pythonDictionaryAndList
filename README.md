# pythonDictionaryAndList
This repository is a Python 3 program that imports population data from a txt file and does some stuff.

window.alert('Hello world!);      # wait, that's JavaScript... whatever.
This is my first gitHub repo, so bear with me.

myDict = {'year_key': [value0, value1, value2] }

This program:

  - reads population data from a txt file
  
  - calculates the length of the file, and given a start year (e.g. 1950),
    uses a loop to create a list with the years 1950 - (len(file_object)
    as the values
    
  - uses another loop to add the year data (as key values) and the
    population data, a zero, and another zero into an empty dictionary
    
        myDict = {'year_key': [value0, value1, value2] }
    
 
 What I'm working on... adding other functions (loops) to:
 
 - calculate the yearly population change, and add that
   number into value1
   
 - calculate it as a percent, add it into value2
 
 - find the min
 - find the max
 - find the average
